# 🧭 Web Dev Quest Log

Welcome to my modular study tracker for Shaw Academy’s Web Development course. This repo transforms traditional note-taking into a quest-based progression system—complete with objectives, ASCII sketches, reflections, and ability unlocks.

## 🗂️ Structure

- `/quests`: Modular quest logs for each learning module
- `codex.md`: Tracks unlocked titles, abilities, and phase progression
- `/assets`: ASCII sketches, diagrams, and visual aids
- `/skill-tree.md`: Visualizes ability

## 🧪 Current Phase

**Phase 1: HTML & CSS Foundations**  
Status: `🟢 In Progress`

## 🧠 Philosophy

This system gamifies mastery. Each quest is a self-contained learning module with clear goals, visual structure, and post-quest reinforcements. The codex acts as a living ledger of my growth—like a character sheet in an RPG.

## 🛡️ Tools Used

- Markdown for modular logging
- GitHub for version control and auditability
- ASCII for visual scaffolding
